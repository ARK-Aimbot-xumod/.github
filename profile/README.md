## Overview

Studio Wildcard’s sandbox pits you on a dino-infested island where ranged duels decide who keeps their loot. Lag, projectile drop, and unpredictable hit-boxes mean vanilla aim feels like tossing spears blindfolded. Our Aimbot counters that chaos with:

* Sub-bone targeting—switch between head, chest, or weak-spot for max damage.
* Bullet-drop calibration—auto-compensates for ARK’s hefty projectile physics.
* Smart prediction—reads target velocity to land airborne or mounted shots.
* Built-in 3D ESP for players, dinos, loot drops, and traps.

> **Why it matters:** BattlEye‐protected officials demand flawless timing—one whiff and you’re in spectator mode.

## Why Our Aimbot Obliterates the Competition 💥

BattlEye’s kernel scans memory on the fly, making static cheats a ban magnet. Our injector randomizes code caves each boot, keeping signatures fresh. Pair that with packet-level silent aim—near-zero view-angle jumps equals fewer reports. Reddit threads confirm unofficial servers often disable the anti-cheat entirely; that’s easy prey.

## System Requirements

ARK is a hungry beast: GTX 670/HD 7870 GPU, 60 GB storage, and at least an Intel i5-2400 or FX-8320 CPU for stable frames. Our aimbot runs lean—<2 % CPU usage and <150 MB RAM overhead—so you won’t tank FPS during giga raids.

## Instant-Install Guide

1. Run `PrimalInjector.exe`.
2. The game launches automatically.
3. Aimbot overlay appears at menu—hit **F6** to enable.
4. Join any non-BattlEye server or spoof first for officials.
5. Crosshair turns crimson when lock is live—**GG!**

## FAQ

**Q1: Will BattlEye detect it instantly?**
BattlEye relies on signature scans; our tool randomizes memory regions each boot, so detection windows stay tiny.

**Q2: Can I use it on official servers?**
Yes—spoof hardware IDs first and keep the injector updated to bypass BattlEye rules.

**Q3: Does silent aim look obvious in replays?**
No. Packets adjust hit-registration server-side, so kill-cams appear natural to spectators.

**Q4: Is the ESP customizable?**
Absolutely—toggle colors, distance filters, tribe IDs, even dino species tags from the overlay.

**Q5: Will it hurt my FPS?**
Overlay draws with Direct X hooks and pulls <2 % CPU plus minor VRAM, barely nudging performance overhead.
